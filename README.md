### Tinder like web app to connect entrepreneurs with developers


### !important
I am gonna work on backend with Node js. In order to connect front-end with back-end, you guys need to understand a concept,fetch,calling data from backend with javascript. This might be overwhelming, but this is super important to make our website to be dynamic. We can have a group session on Saturday for me to cover this and show you guys some examples.

### Tech Stack

Front-end: semantic HTML / CSS + FlexBox + Bootstrap4(CSS Framework) / Plain(Vanilla) JAVASCRIPT

Back-end: Node js(Restful API) (Do not worry about this for the time being)


### Reference

FlexBox: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7EIAgfkhmg&t=2s

Bootstrap4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnCmSXCZEpU

We are only gonna use a few ui components from Bootstrap and implement our own grid and layout.

Template Literals(no more appendChild):

time(Date): https://momentjs.com/

functional programming utility library(such as map, filter, reduce): https://lodash.com/

chart ui library: http://www.chartjs.org/

typed js: https://mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/

### A few CSS library we might use

### Work Flow

Invision(Design prototype tool) => HTML/CSS(mobile first) => Lucid Chart (JS application logic chart) => connect with Back-end


### Documentation

We are gonna use Quip.com. I already sent out invitations to everyone.
We will document every single group session we are gonna have and any helpful resources.  
Click JavascriptNinjas to find HTML/CSS/JS

### Communication

We are gonna use a private slack channel
I already sent out an invitation to everyone
There are three channels, HTML/CSS/JS

### Meeting

Sung will assign 3-4 tickets every Monday to each developer.

If you do not finish your tickets by Saturday, please drop them to backlog!

Every Saturday 10 am, we are gonna have a ticket grooming session / feedback time.

When we have to go over a new concept as a group, we are gonna use a codeshare editor I built:

### DEV workflow

first time -

git clone

git checkout -b dev

git pull origin dev

When you want to push

git status

git add .

git commit -m 'be specific'

git push origin dev


Every time you work on dev branch, do not forget to pull

git pull origin dev (Let's say I worked on JS and pushed to dev, then co-workers should have the same code on their local files)
